# 20-sim
Review for the 20-sim 5.1 installer.

Maintainers: @katepavlu, @20-sim, @margro

**Is the program properly opened?**
Grade: Platinum
Additional notes: n/a

**Is it showing alerts or other warnings?**
Grade: Platinum
Additional notes: n/a

**Does it show graphical glitches?**
Grade: Bronze
Additional notes: UI sometime loads slowly. Black rectangles are sometimes brifly shown instead of UI elements, but they resolve after hovering. If the file is saved when the simulation window is maximized, it can glitch out next time it is opened, but settles once it is un-maximized.

**Does it require some tweaking in order to work properly? (Out of normal software configuration)**
Grade: Platinum
Additional notes: n/a

**Did it crash during tests execution?**
Grade: Bronze
Additional notes: Can crash while resolving the maximized simulation window issue.

**Is it usable?**
Grade: Gold
Additional notes: UI can be a little slow.

**Final grade? (the lower evaluation from previous questions)**
Grade: Bronze
Additional notes: n/a
