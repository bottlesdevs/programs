# Evernote
Review for the Evernote installer.

Maintainer: @robert-ulrich-hofmann

**Is the program properly opened?**
Grade: Platinum
Additional notes: Installer works without problems. Program is opened without Problems.

**Is it showing alerts or other warnings?**
Grade: Silver
Additional notes: The Program itself does not show warnings. The app produces tons of warnings and a few errors in the Bottles console but it's an electron app and very chatty, it seems stable to me.

**Does it show graphical glitches?**
Grade: Silver
Additional notes: There are two major glitches: Context menus have a broad black shadow around them when opened, but the shadows immediately vanish after opening and do not obstruct any information or control. The tray icon for Evernote appears correctly in the system tray but when right-clicking it the context menu only opens while the main window is minimized.

**Does it require some tweaking in order to work properly? (Out of normal software configuration)**
Grade: Platinum
Additional notes: n/a

**Did it crash during tests execution?**
Grade: Platinum
Additional notes: n/a

**Is it usable?**
Grade: Platinum
Additional notes: The app works without problems. All UI elements render and are useable. Links open correctly in the system's standard browser outside of Bottles.

**Final grade? (the lower evaluation from previous questions)**
Grade: Silver.
Additional notes: I am not an evernote user so I can't really test the real program / workflows. I don't know if the tray icon context menu is needed while the app is maximized. From installation and startup / login I would say this runs good enough.
