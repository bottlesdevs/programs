# Streamer.bot
Review for the streamerbot installer.

Maintainer: @joacoslime

**Is the program properly opened?**
Grade: Platinum
Additional notes: n/a

**Is it showing alerts or other warnings?**
Grade: Platinum
Additional notes: n/a

**Does it show graphical glitches?**
Grade: Gold
Additional notes: The startup splash screen is black for a second before showing the logo. In some wine versions, a considerable ammount of empty GlassPanelForm windows are created.

**Does it require some tweaking in order to work properly? (Out of normal software configuration)**
Grade: Gold
Additional notes: The installation may fail in bottles where mono is already installed. Also, I recommend using caffe as the launcher, it's the stablest wine version I found.

**Did it crash during tests execution?**
Grade: Platinum
Additional notes: n/a

**Is it usable?**
Grade: Gold
Additional notes: Sometimes the program freezes seconds after running it. The UI is a bit slow.

**Final grade? (the lower evaluation from previous questions)**
Grade: Gold
Additional notes: n/a

**Additional notes**
It should be more stress-tested, I didn't test it while streaming.
