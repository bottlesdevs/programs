# Wargaming.NET Game Center
Review for Wargaming.NET Game Center Installer. You can use the Game Center to install all Wargaming Games (World of Tanks, World of Battleships, etc.) I tested the Launcher and World of Tanks, can not speak for the other games that are distributed with it.

**Is the program properly opened?**  
Grade: Platinum  
Additional notes: Installation works flawless. After Installation the Game Center opens and you can download any Wargaming Game (World of Tanks, World of Warships, etc.) The downloads are as fast as can be and can pick up where they left off if interrupted by any means (closing launcher, killing connection).

**Is it showing alerts or other warnings?**  
Grade: Platinum  
Additional notes: No.

**Does it show graphical glitches?**  
Grade: Platinum  
Additional notes: Everything works, even the videos have lag-free playback and sound.

**Does it require some tweaking in order to work properly? (Out of normal software configuration)**  
Grade: Platinum  
Additional notes: No.

**Did it crash during tests execution?**  
Grade: Platinum  
Additional notes: The Game Center never crashed.

**Is it usable?**  
Grade: Platinum  
Additional notes: The Game Center is usable like on Windows. It's as snappy and performs game downloads and installations flawlessly. I played around with the settings of the Game Center and everything works as expected. I used it to install World of Tanks and the Game Center as well as the game have stellar performance. No hickups, never crashed. World of Tanks runs on my potato machine with >100 FPS.

**Final grade? (the lower evaluation from previous questions)**  
Grade: Platinum  
Additional notes: No.
